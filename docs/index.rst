This add-on allows an administrator to impersonate another user.

This is useful for verifying workflows, permissions, and roles set up on real content and on live sites.

How to Impersonate a User
-------------------------

You must be logged in as a user with Manager or Site Administrator role.

Use the Impersonate item in your personal menu at the bottom of the toolbar.
